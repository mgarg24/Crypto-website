    <h1> What I want to work on in the next little bit</h1>
    <p>First off I just want to make alot of money. In order to make that money I am going to have to work on the following things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trading</li>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>Research into projects</li>
        
    </ul>

    <p>What are my high-conviction plays? I am not really sure but these ones are on my radar:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href= "https://frax.finance/"> Frax</a></li>
